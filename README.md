# Learning_Open3D
The examples included above are based on the tutorial from Open3D using both Python and C++. Open3D is a really good library. For the Pyhton tutorial, it's better to follow the [official Python tutorial](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html), which is super great. But unfortunately there isn't a same C++ tutorial, that's why I want to create this document. Hope it can help you when developing with Open3D!
