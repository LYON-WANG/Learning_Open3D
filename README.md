# Learning_Open3D
The examples included above are based on the tutorial from Open3D using both Python and C++. For the Pyhton tutorial, it's better to follow the [official tutorial](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html). But there isn't a same C++ tutorial, that's why I want to create this document. Hope it can help you!
